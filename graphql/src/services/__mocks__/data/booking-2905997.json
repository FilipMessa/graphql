Other health organisations may recommend alternative precautions.<br /><br /><p>\nVaccinations not required.\n</p>\n<h3>Recommended Health and Vaccination precautions:</h3>\n<p>\n</p><p>\nVaccination against yellow fever for all passengers of 9 months of age and older visiting jungle areas below 2300m in Peru. Travellers who will only visit the cities of Cuzco and Lima, Machu Picchu and the Inca trail and some areas west of the Andes, do not need vaccination. <br />Malaria prophylaxis: malaria risk (P. vivax and P. falciparum) exists throughout the year in rural areas at altitudes below 2000m. The 23 highest risk districts are concentrated in the departments of Ayacucho, Junin, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Piura, San Martin and Tumbes. Most P. falciparum cases are reported from Loreto. Recommended prevention: <strong>B</strong> in P. vivax risk areas; <strong>C</strong> in department of Loreto. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn Timatic, the recommended type of prevention is referred to as: <br />- Type A (very limited risk of malaria transmission) - Mosquito bite prevention only.<br />- Type B (risk of P. vivax malaria only) - Mosquito bite prevention plus chloroquine chemoprophylaxis.<br />- Type C (risk of P. falciparum malaria with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance) - Mosquito bite prevention plus atovaquone-proguanil or doxycyline or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis.<br />- Type D (risk of P. falciparum malaria plus reported multi-drug resistance) - Mosquito bite prevention plus plus atovaquone-proguanil or doxycyline or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis, depending on local drug restistance.<br />Chemoprophylaxis should be started preferably one week before departure and no later than the first day of exposure; it must be taken with unfailing regularity and continued for 4 weeks after the last exposure. No prophylactic regimen is 100% protective against infection, but even if it fails to prevent the disease it may, nevertheless, render the infection milder and less life threatening. \n</p>\n\n</div>",
