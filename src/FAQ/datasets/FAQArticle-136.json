However, the practice of “throwaway ticketing” — only using the first part of a round-trip ticket — is prohibited by a majority of airlines in their terms and conditions —- please review these terms of each chosen airline for more information.</div><div>Airlines may impose certain sanctions including invoicing an additional amount up to the standard fare of the one-way alternative, deletion of mileage programs, etc. Yet, the probability of this is minimal, because such a breach can only be identified after the flights have departed.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>By proceeding with this booking, you confirm that you are aware of all conditions and potential issues related with using just one leg of a round-trip itinerary.&nbsp;</div><div>If you do not want to purchase an itinerary with throwaway segments, please return to our search page and choose a standard direct itinerary.</div>",
